## Here are some beginner-friendly project ideas that cover various aspects of Python programming:
### 1.	Simple Calculator: 
Create a command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. the user input should should be two numbers with the operator, which means you should use only one input statement and the user should enter an input that looks like this "num1\*num2"
1234\*3456

### 2.	To-Do List Application: 
Develop a to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. You can use lists or dictionaries to store tasks and provide options for users to interact with the list. use fancy decorators. 

### 3.	Guess the Number Game: 
Implement a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it. Provide hints like "too high" or "too low" after each guess, and keep track of the number of attempts.

### 4.	Temperature Converter: 
Build a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Allow users to input the temperature in one scale and output it in the other scale.

### 5.	Word Count Tool: 
Create a tool that analyzes a text document and counts the occurrences of each word. You can also include features like finding the most common words or displaying word frequencies. the input should be a text file.

### 6.	Mini-Python Chatbot: 
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user input with predefined messages. You can implement basic conversation flows and include features like asking for the user's name or providing information on a specific topic. you need to use random to randomize the computers answers 

### 7.	Dice Rolling Simulator: 
Create a program that simulates rolling dice. Allow users to specify the number of dice and the number of sides on each die. Display the results of each roll and calculate the total sum.

### 8.	Personal Budget Tracker: 
Develop a simple budget tracker that allows users to input their income and expenses. Calculate the total balance and display it along with a breakdown of expenses by category.
