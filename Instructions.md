3. Switch to this branch to start working on your tasks.

1. After committing your changes, click the "Push origin" button in GitHub Desktop.
2. This will upload your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

### 6. Submit a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. You should see a message asking if you'd like to create a pull request for the branch you just pushed. Click "Compare & pull request."
3. Set the base repository to the original repository (the one you forked from).
4. Set the base branch to `main`.
5. Name the pull request with your group name and a description of what you've done, e.g., "Group 1 - New Year Schedule Page."
6. Click "Create pull request."
